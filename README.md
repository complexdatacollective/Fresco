# Fresco

The Fresco project aims to bring Network Canvas interviews to the web browser. It is a pilot project that does not
add new features to Network Canvas, but rather provides a new way to conduct interviews.

Read our [documentation](https://documentation.networkcanvas.com/en/fresco) for more information on deploying Fresco.
