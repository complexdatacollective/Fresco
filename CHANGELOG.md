# fresco

## 4.3.2

### Bug fixes

- Usage statistics now count each interview start and each protocol install once. Before, both were counted twice. The protocol-install event also no longer includes the protocol's file name.

## 4.3.1

### Interview changes

These improvements to the interview are shared with Interviewer and Architect's Preview.

- **Dragging on touch screens.** Dragging people out of a scrolling area now goes the way you'd expect. In the Sociogram's bin you can drag a person straight up or diagonally onto the canvas, and swiping sideways scrolls the bin. In the roster and name generator panels, swiping up and down scrolls and dragging sideways moves a person. To drag along the direction an area scrolls, hold the person still for a moment first.

### Bug fixes

- Building the Docker image no longer stops while uploading error-reporting source maps.

## 4.3.0

### Docker deployments

- **Existing deployments don't need to do anything.** If you already run Fresco with the bundled MinIO storage, keep your current compose file and everything carries on as before. Deployments using external S3 storage or UploadThing are also unaffected.
- **New deployments with bundled storage now use Garage instead of MinIO**, because the MinIO image is no longer published. A new deployment using `docker-compose.prod.yml` needs two values in `.env`, `GARAGE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `GARAGE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and the compose file prints the commands that generate them. Fresco's storage setup step is then filled in for you. Docker Engine 25 and Docker Compose 2.23.1 or later are required. If you ever move an existing deployment to the new compose file, you will need to move your files from the `minio` Docker volume into Garage yourself.

### New features

- **Seven new languages.** Fresco is now available in Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese, as well as English and Spanish. Pick one from the language setting, which now has a search box, or let Fresco follow the browser's language. The interview controls participants see are translated too; a protocol's own text stays in the language it was written in. The pages participants see outside the interview, such as the pages for a broken or expired link, the screen-too-small notice and the thank-you page, now appear in their language too, and the thank-you page follows the language chosen in the interview. Fresco downloads only the language in use, and an interview in another language opens without waiting for it.
- **Post-quantum passkeys.** Devices and password managers that support post-quantum passkeys can now register one with Fresco. Existing passkeys keep working.
- **More storage providers.** Uploads now work with S3-compatible services that check upload checksums, including Garage.

### Interview changes

These improvements to the interview are shared with Interviewer and Architect's Preview.

- **Passphrase-protected answers.** For studies that protect answers with a passphrase, protected answers are no longer lost or saved in a way that can't be read back, and participants are told when an answer wasn't saved so they can try again. Once some answers are protected, a passphrase that can't read them is turned away with a message, so a typo can't start protecting new answers with a different passphrase. The passphrase button is now available on phones and portrait screens.
- **Family pedigree.** Complex families now draw correctly, including half-siblings, step-parents, chains of partnerships and children whose parents aren't a couple. A participant's chosen terms are kept when the pedigree is reopened, and the "finalized" notice no longer hides the bottom of a tall pedigree.
- **Network Composer.** Changes in the side panel are saved when the panel closes instead of being lost, and undo and redo now update the panel.
- **Accessibility.** Screen readers name each person by the label on their node wherever the interview mentions them.

### Data safety and privacy

- **Unreadable interviews are never overwritten.** If an interview's saved answers can't be read, Fresco shows the participant an error, refuses to save over it, and stops exports and the interview data API with an error instead of treating it as empty.
- **Unreadable protocols are never treated as empty.** If a protocol's design can't be read, Fresco refuses to start its interviews, and its recruitment links, synthetic data, exports and interview data API report an error.
- **Frozen interviews stay frozen.** A save that was still under way when an interview finished, for example from a second tab, is now declined.
- **Netlify deploy previews no longer migrate the production database.** Previously a preview of a newer version could migrate it and break every interview link. Previews that share production's database settings still connect to that database when visited.
- **Exports.** CSV and GraphML exports mark an answer as ENCRYPTED only when it was actually saved encrypted.
- **Analytics.** Interview analytics no longer include protocol details such as codebook type names or validation messages.

### Bug fixes

- Dashboard actions such as deleting interviews, participants, protocols or API tokens, managing users and passkeys, changing your password, and setting up or turning off two-factor authentication now wait until they're done and show an error if they fail. A refused two-factor code now shows why.
- The sandbox's sign-in page and dashboard keep working, and the demo sign-in details stay visible.
- The dashboard navigation bar no longer causes an error for researchers with reduced motion turned on.
- Fewer false error reports, and clearer ones: a failed page now reports an identifier that can be traced, and a deployment whose error reporting is off is told so.
- The page for a failed interview link no longer mentions onboarding.
- Long ordinal bin labels are no longer cut off.
- Names that couldn't be added on a name generator are no longer cleared.
- Navigation buttons stay on screen on small phones and at larger text sizes.
- Updated third-party libraries.

## 4.2.1

### Patch Changes

- d8a6661: Opening a newly created interview no longer crashes with "Maximum update depth
  exceeded" on a slow connection. The overlay container behind dialogs and
  toasts reacted to being detached while the page was still waiting for the
  interview to download, and that reaction re-rendered the page in a loop until
  React gave up. The interview now waits for its data and opens normally.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d4585b: Effect 4.

  `@codaco/network-exporters` is built against Effect 4 and no longer bundles or
  depends on Effect itself: `effect` is now a **peer dependency**
  (`^4.0.0-rc.115`). Install it alongside the package, or the package will not
  resolve at runtime. Effect 4 has no stable release yet, so ask for the release
  candidate by tag — `npm install effect@rc`. A plain `effect@^4` matches
  nothing, because a caret range with no prerelease component does not match a
  prerelease. The peer is what guarantees one Effect copy, and so one fiber
  runtime, in an application that also uses Effect directly.

  Two pieces of the package's public surface change shape with the major:

  - The three service tags — `InterviewRepository`, `ProtocolRepository` and
    `Output` — are `Context.Service` classes rather than `Context.Tag` classes.
    Providing them is unchanged (`Layer.succeed(Output, impl)` still works); only
    the declaration form differs, which matters if you were extending or
    re-declaring one.
  - `Fiber.RuntimeFiber` collapsed into `Fiber.Fiber` in Effect 4, so the sink
    handle that `makeZipOutput` carries is typed `Fiber.Fiber<OutputResult,
OutputError>`.

  Error classes are unchanged: they remain `Data.TaggedError`, so nothing in the
  package's public types pulls in Effect Schema.

  Fresco and Interviewer move to Effect 4 with it, and each picks up a fix to a
  drain that Effect 4 made visible:

  - Fresco's batch export flushes its remaining progress events by ending the
    queue and taking what is buffered. Effect 4's `Queue.takeAll` suspends on an
    open empty queue instead of returning nothing, and an empty queue at that
    point is the ordinary case, so the old line would have hung the export's
    response open indefinitely.
  - Interviewer's export runner now ends its event queue and joins the drain
    fiber before finishing, so every progress event has reached the UI callback
    before the export resolves. Previously the last events were delivered only
    because the pipeline happened to yield to the scheduler between them, and
    were dropped when it did not.

- 4326572: Stop reporting the running Fresco version and process uptime from the unauthenticated `/api/health` endpoint. It still answers liveness probes with the service status, so container healthchecks and load balancers keep working, but an anonymous caller can no longer learn which release an instance runs. Signed-in researchers continue to see the version on the dashboard.
- 3c6cba3: Passkeys now have to verify who you are. Fresco asks every passkey to confirm your identity with a PIN, fingerprint, or face when it is registered and each time you sign in, and refuses a response in which the authenticator skipped that check. A passkey sign-in therefore always proves both that you hold the device and that you are its user, which is the assurance the Accounts & Security documentation describes.

  Previously Fresco requested this verification but accepted responses without it, so a hardware security key with no PIN could sign in on possession of the key alone.

  Deployments that set `REQUIRE_TWO_FACTOR` exempt passkey-mode accounts from that requirement because a passkey already replaces the password; that exemption relied on the passkey proving the user's identity, which was not previously guaranteed. It now is.

  A passkey registered on a security key that cannot verify you no longer signs in, and Fresco tells you what to check rather than reporting a generic failure or, when the browser closes the passkey prompt on its own, saying nothing at all. Sign in with another of your passkeys, or ask another administrator to use **Reset Auth** on your account. If you are already signed in, add a passkey that verifies you from **Settings → User Management** before you sign out. Registering a new passkey on such a key is refused with the same explanation.

- b51743b: Add a `REQUIRE_TWO_FACTOR` environment variable. When it is set to `true`, every account that signs in with a password must set up two-factor authentication immediately after signing in — or, for the first administrator of a new deployment, immediately after the setup wizard — before any dashboard page or signed-in request is served, and cannot turn it off afterwards. An administrator can still reset a locked-out colleague's authentication; that account sets two-factor authentication up again at its next sign-in. It is an environment variable rather than a dashboard setting because every Fresco account is an equal administrator, so anything switchable from the dashboard could be switched off by any of them; the User Management card reports whether it is in force. Accounts that sign in with a passkey are not affected.
- 0587866: Add English, British English, and Spanish throughout Fresco’s researcher interface, with an account language preference that applies immediately and persists across devices. Choose the language from the globe button in the dashboard’s top bar (in the navigation menu on small screens), or in the header of the sign-in and setup screens; the choice made during setup carries over to the new account. If a choice cannot be saved, it stays in use for the visit and the language list offers to try again. Localize server-rendered pages, validation, dialogs, notifications, and structured activity details while preserving existing audit records and research data.

  The selected language also initializes built-in interview controls. Temporary interview-menu choices leave the account preference, protocol-authored text, and stored answers unchanged.

- 29b11be: Built-in interview controls, help, validation, dialogs and accessibility messages
  are available in English, British English and Spanish. The interview menu now
  includes an interface language chooser, with all messages available offline.

  Hosts can pass a preference or an already negotiated language through
  `Shell.requestedLocale`; the interview package finds the best match among its
  own supported languages. `onLocaleChange` lets hosts persist menu choices, and
  `InterviewI18nProvider` gives inline field previews the same negotiation and
  catalogs. Language changes preserve entered answers, open forms and the current
  interview position. Protocol-authored content and research values keep their
  existing language and meaning.

### Patch Changes

- 0968b01: Response options read in full in the categorical and ordinal bins. A researcher
  can write an option as a whole sentence — "Previously involved in the criminal
  legal system, but not currently" is an ordinary thing for a study to ask — and
  the bin now sizes that text to the room it actually has, a step at a time, in
  place of cutting it off mid-word. Where a bin is too small to hold every word
  even at the smallest readable size, the text fades at the edge rather than
  stopping without warning, and the whole option is still read out by a screen
  reader.

  Two ways an option could disappear entirely are fixed. In a tall window, an
  ordinal bin's heading could be pushed out through the top and bottom of its own
  panel, leaving a coloured band with nothing in it. In a narrow one, the labels
  were cut part-way through a line of text.

  A bin that holds people shows who is in it underneath the option, as before. It
  now steps aside when the option itself needs the room, instead of being cut in
  half, and comes back as soon as there is room again.

  Emphasis authored in an option — **bold** or _italic_ — now reads as emphasis
  against the label's own weight, and a screen reader is handed the words without
  the markdown around them.

- e322f90: Open a protocol whose resources are missing, and never write one that is

  A protocol whose archive was missing one of its files could not be opened at
  all, in any version of Architect. Architect now opens it, says which resources
  are missing, and offers to add the files from Resources — every stage, prompt
  and variable in it stays exactly as it was. Interviewer and Fresco still refuse
  such a protocol, because a resource that never loads would surface to a
  participant mid-interview.

  Downloading a protocol whose resources cannot all be read is now refused rather
  than quietly producing a file without them. That file could not be opened
  anywhere: dropping a resource left the stages that used it pointing at nothing.
  Nothing is lost by refusing — the protocol stays in your library exactly as it
  was, and the message names the files to restore.

  A protocol archive whose contents are damaged is now described as damaged,
  instead of falling back to "could not be opened". The message shown when a
  protocol refers to a file it does not contain names the resource as you named
  it, rather than its internal filename.

  Opening a protocol that turns out to be damaged, unreadable, or too old to
  upgrade is no longer recorded as an application error by Architect or Fresco.
  Those are answers about the file, and recording them buried the failures that
  are real faults; the kind of problem is recorded instead, which also keeps your
  own resource names out of analytics.

  Fresco now reads archives through the shared reader, so the limit that protects
  against a maliciously compressed protocol applies to its imports too, and its
  media is resolved against the manifest that shipped inside the archive.
  Interviewer reads a pending protocol's name under the same limit.

  **Breaking (`@codaco/protocol-validation`):** `extractProtocol` and
  `extractProtocolFromZip` no longer throw when the manifest names a file the
  archive does not contain. They return it in a new `missingAssets` array and
  leave the policy to the host; call `missingAssetsError` to raise the refusal
  runtimes share. Also adds `createNetcanvasReader`, for hosts that read
  `protocol.json` and the media separately under one shared inflation limit,
  exports `getProtocolFileErrorKind` for classifying a failure without formatting
  a message, and adds `unreadable-entry` to `MalformedNetcanvasReason`.

- afef196: The unexported-interview warning in the delete dialogs now stays on screen while the dialog animates away, instead of disappearing a moment before it. Dashboard tables no longer rebuild their action menus on every render.
- d6cb713: Session replay and heatmap capture are now off on every page, not only participant ones. Enabling either on the dashboard could send data neither optional analytics feature was meant to include: heatmaps key their captured data by the full page URL, and the participants and interviews tables put the researcher's search text there as a query parameter; session replay can capture whatever the current page renders, including the TOTP secret on the two-factor setup screen and recovery codes or freshly created API tokens on the settings screen, and the recorder's default masking does not cover plain text or images. Fresco reports only the usage events it emits explicitly.
- c6f88e9: Optional analytics no longer carry interview identifiers. Error reports from the interview sync and finish endpoints, and the "Interview Opened" usage event, previously included the interview id (and, for researchers, the username) in what was sent to the analytics relay. An interview id is the participant's access link, so those properties are replaced with non-identifying context, matching the redaction the browser-side analytics already applied. In the browser, PostHog autocapture, rageclick and dead-click capture are now switched off throughout Fresco, as they already were in Interviewer and Architect, and any element data (such as the text of a clicked button) reaching the send path is dropped: a clicked node's name is a participant's answer, and the dashboard's tables show participant identifiers and labels. Heatmap capture is off throughout Fresco as well, and any `$$heatmap` flush that reaches the send path is dropped. Fresco reports only the usage events it emits explicitly. The security policy is also corrected: TOTP secrets are stored as-is because they must remain readable to verify codes; recovery codes and API tokens are the values stored hashed.
- 64c7891: `Badge` is now the one label chip, replacing three overlapping components that
  rendered the same kind of object differently depending on which one a call site
  happened to pick.

  `Badge` gains semantic `tone`s (`neutral`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`,
  `info`, `success`, `warning`, `destructive`), each painted in a `filled` or
  `outline` `appearance` from the theme's colour pairs so it follows light and
  dark mode; three sizes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`); `mono` and `uppercase` typography
  options; a leading `icon` slot; the palette `color` prop for taxonomic
  colouring; and a Base UI `render` override for rendering as a button, toggle
  or animated element. Its default look is unchanged.

  `Tag` keeps its name, API and look but is now a `Badge` with a toggle state
  and palette dot, so the two can no longer drift.

  **Breaking:** `Pill` and the `@codaco/fresco-ui/Pill` subpath are removed —
  use `Badge` with `mono` (and `appearance="outline"` for the outlined look).
  `Badge`'s `variant` prop is replaced by `tone` and `appearance`:
  `variant="secondary"` → `tone="secondary"`, `variant="destructive"` →
  `tone="destructive"`, `variant="outline"` → `appearance="outline"`; the
  default needs no props.

  The interview runtime's offline map banner; Architect's codebook usage chips, library counts, asset cards and the
  requires-internet label on protocol cards; Interviewer's deck card label;
  Background Creator's zone pills; and Fresco's activity feed, interview,
  participant and passkey chips all render through it.

- a382c6b: Add `Tag`, a compact uppercase label with an optional palette-coloured dot that becomes an `aria-pressed` toggle button when given `onPressedChange` — the shape used for multi-select facet filters. Architect's New Stage capability filter now uses it.

  `GridLayout` accepts `maxColumns`, so a collection can cap its column count while wider containers grow the items instead. Internally, `Badge` and `Tag` now read the named palette from one shared map.

  New typographic levels for compact secondary text: `Eyebrow`, a bold uppercase monospace label with `muted`, `default`, `primary` and `subtle` tones, the last dropping the bold face for a classifier set beside its subject; `Paragraph` intents `caption` and `meta` (tight-leading small text, the latter monospace); and a `Heading` `subtitle` variant that keeps the level's size but sets a semibold face on snug leading for long titles. `Paragraph` also accepts a `render` prop, like `Heading`, to substitute the rendered element.

  `STAGE_TYPE_COLORS` and `STAGE_TYPE_ICONS` map every protocol stage type to a palette colour and a Lucide icon, both keyed by the schema's stage union so a new interface cannot ship without either. Each icon is chosen for what its interface does, and — where Network Canvas already drew that interface its own icon — for the closest silhouette to it, so the set still reads as Network Canvas. `isStageType` narrows a type read from protocol JSON; `stageTypeColorStyle` gives the colour as CSS variables and `stageTypeIcon` the icon component. `StageBar` draws a stage sequence as a colour strip from the colour map; the website's protocol gallery uses both.

- 1dac91b: The interview runtime's optional analytics no longer use the interview session id as the per-event `distinct_id`. In Fresco that id is the participant's unauthenticated access link, so it must not leave the deployment. Events are now grouped under a random per-session pseudonym generated in the browser, held in memory for the life of the session alongside the existing entity-id pseudonyms. Analytics still group one session's events together; a page reload starts a new pseudonym. Errors the Name Generator raises for a malformed encrypted attribute no longer embed the node's id in their message, since error reports can be captured by analytics and a node id is a participant-network identifier the runtime otherwise pseudonymises. The same is true of a duplicate-relationship error the Family Pedigree interface throws, which no longer names the two node ids it connects.
- 23dcf99: Analytics now reports a session-scoped pseudonym for every entity id, rather
  than the interview's own `_uid`.

  The event taxonomy admits `node_id` and `edge_id` on the premise that they are
  random values minted at creation time, derived from nothing a participant
  supplied. Roster nodes break that premise: an external-data row is keyed as
  `${subjectType}_${hash({ node, index })}`, a deterministic, unkeyed digest of
  the row's own content, and the node is added to the network under exactly that
  key. Anyone holding the roster could recompute the digest and so recognise
  which roster row an event was about, and because the digest does not vary the
  same person carried the same identifier in every interview — so events from
  separate sessions about one person could be joined together.

  Each session now mints a random pseudonym per entity, held in memory and never
  persisted or transmitted. Events within a session still join on the entity,
  which is all these properties are for; nothing joins across sessions or back to
  a roster row. The substitution happens at the tracker, the single boundary every
  event passes through, so no emitter can reintroduce a raw identifier. When
  events fire, and which events fire, is unchanged.

- a13f261: Every module that runs a React hook now declares `'use client'`, so a Next App
  Router application can import this runtime from a Server Component.

  Seventy-four modules were missing the directive: the navigation, node list, node
  drawer and panel components, the canvas layers and their layout hooks, the
  protocol form, and the Anonymisation, CategoricalBin, DyadCensus, EgoForm,
  FamilyPedigree, Geospatial, NameGenerator, NameGeneratorRoster, Narrative,
  NarrativePedigree, NetworkComposer, OneToManyDyadCensus, OrdinalBin, SlidesForm
  and Sociogram interfaces. An unmarked module is treated as server code, so
  reaching one from a Server Component's import graph failed the build rather than
  rendering.

  The published bundles now carry the directive too. Bundling had been erasing it,
  so even the modules that already declared it arrived at npm consumers unmarked.
  `dist/index.js` and the lazily loaded Geospatial chunks are now marked;
  `dist/contract.js` and `dist/protocol-schema-version.js` are unmarked, as their
  server safety intends, and stay that way only for as long as no module carrying
  the directive is reachable from them.

  Architect, Interviewer and Fresco are released alongside because each bundles
  this runtime. Nothing about how an interview looks or behaves changes.

- c5758a4: Fix text in the Information interface being unselectable. It carried an `allow-text-selection` marker class meant to override the host app's global `user-select: none`, but the shared-theme migration dropped the CSS utility that implemented it (as an apparent "zero consumers" cleanup) without noticing this interface still relied on it, so the override silently stopped doing anything. Participants and researchers previewing an Information stage could not select or copy its text. Now uses Tailwind's built-in `select-text`, which restores the original behaviour by inheritance since nothing inside the interface sets its own `user-select`.
- a78b7c2: A video on an interview screen now announces itself with the description the
  researcher wrote for it, and falls back to the asset's file name only when
  nobody has written one. An image has always read that description as its alt
  text and an audio player as its own name; the video player was the one place
  that ignored it, so a participant listening to the screen heard a filename
  where every other medium said what the thing was.

  A description a researcher left blank now counts as no description at all, for
  pictures and audio as well as video. A protocol written by hand or brought in
  from elsewhere can carry a description of nothing but spaces, and every medium
  used to pass it straight through — so a participant using a screen reader was
  told a run of whitespace instead of what the file was called.

- f6565fe: Interview screens now settle in one step where they previously took two. Moving to the next pair in Dyad Census or Tie Strength Census, changing prompt in Categorical Bin, Sociogram or Geospatial, and opening a name generator's edit form no longer render a frame that still carries the previous item's state.

  Place search is more accurate about what it tells a screen reader: a status that has been superseded is no longer read back when a query starts matching again, and a search still in flight when the participant moves on can no longer repopulate the next person's suggestions.

  An encrypted name that could not be decrypted after the passphrase changed now shows the locked indicator instead of the name read earlier under the old passphrase.

- 553d580: Added `@codaco/fresco-ui/hooks/useHasHydrated`, the one implementation of "is this tree past hydration" for the handful of things only a browser can answer. It replaces eight hand-rolled copies across the design system and the apps.

  In Fresco, the anonymous recruitment URL and the passkey option on the sign-in and sign-up forms now appear as soon as the page is interactive, without the extra render pass they used to wait for.

## 4.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 79cabf8: Fresco can be deployed to Vercel again. Since 4.1.0 every Vercel
  deployment failed during the build with
  `ENOENT: .next/next-server.js.nft.json`. Next.js 16.3 stopped writing that
  file-trace manifest when `output: 'standalone'` is set, and Vercel's build
  adapter needs it to package the app's serverless functions. Fresco sets
  `output: 'standalone'` only for its Docker image, so it is now switched off
  when building on Vercel. Container and Netlify deployments are unaffected.

  The consequence reached further than a failed build. Fresco applies its
  database migrations before the build runs, so an upgrade attempted on Vercel
  migrated the schema and then failed — leaving the previous deployment, still
  serving, reading a database whose shape it no longer understood. A Vercel
  deployment could therefore take itself offline by trying to upgrade, and
  could not be repaired by redeploying the older version.

  Fixed upstream in Next.js 16.4 (vercel/next.js#96646).

## 4.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 83c17e7: Fix "Must be unique" accepting a duplicate value for a number variable. A number typed into an interview form was compared as text against the numbers already stored on the other alters, so an Alter ID that another alter already held passed the check and the duplicate was added. The same mismatch let a "same as" or "different from" rule misjudge a number answered on an earlier stage. Number values are now compared as numbers wherever a rule reads what the network already holds.

## 4.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 019c1c0: Interview pages now send an origin-only `Referer`, so URL-restricted Mapbox tokens work with Fresco.

  Fresco set `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on `/interview/*` and `/onboard/*` so that the interview id in those URLs could never reach a third party. That also withheld the site's origin, and Mapbox evaluates a token's URL restrictions from the `Referer` header — so a Geospatial stage backed by a URL-restricted token failed with 403 on every map load, leaving researchers no choice but an unrestricted token. Those routes now use `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, the policy every other Fresco route already carried: a cross-origin request carries only the scheme and host, an HTTPS→HTTP downgrade carries nothing, and the full URL, interview id included, is sent only to same-origin requests, which already know it. The protection the old policy provided is unchanged; Mapbox can now see the origin it needs.

  Existing deployments must upgrade to this version to benefit. A deployment on an earlier release still sends no `Referer`, so its Mapbox token has to stay unrestricted.

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b51ef59: Prevent malicious form field paths from modifying object prototypes while preserving dotted protocol variable identifiers and nested field namespaces.
- 873f3bf: Deployments with analytics disabled no longer contact the Network Canvas analytics service.

  Analytics previously started as soon as a page loaded, before the deployment's own setting had been read. A deployment that set `DISABLE_ANALYTICS` or turned analytics off in its settings still requested configuration, supporting scripts, and feature flags on every page load, and could send one anonymous event before the setting took effect. Each new browser also created a new anonymous person record.

  Analytics is now loaded only once the server confirms it is enabled, so a deployment with it disabled makes no requests at all. If the setting cannot be read, nothing is sent. Errors reported from the server now honour the setting too.

  Turning analytics off part-way through a study now takes effect on the server straight away. A deployment that had analytics enabled kept sending server errors until it was restarted, because those reports came from a handler that was set up once and never consulted the setting again. Every server report is now checked against the setting as it is made, including reports of background failures that happen outside a request.

- e9a6522: Network Composer's Undo and Redo controls now retain keyboard focus at the end of the history during interviews hosted by Fresco.
- 79db1ca: Participant interview links no longer reach the analytics service.

  A participant's interview URL contains the identifier that grants access to that interview, and an onboarding link also carries the participant identifier a researcher assigned. Fresco already refuses to send those URLs as a referrer, but on deployments with analytics enabled they were still attached to analytics events as the current page address, including the link address of anything clicked.

  Those identifiers are now removed before any event is sent, on every route a participant sees. Session replay is also switched off for those pages, both when one is opened directly and when a researcher opens an interview from the dashboard — replay stores the page address in a form the removal cannot reach, and a recording of someone answering interview questions is research data rather than analytics.

- 06bc1e9: The quick add usage hint on name generator stages no longer promises that the box stays open when only one more item can be added during interviews hosted by Fresco.
- e9a6522: Fresco now handles recruitment links, activity reporting, hosted interview dialogs, and operational errors more reliably.

  - Recruitment links for missing protocols show an actionable invalid-link page instead of a generic application error.
  - Activity feed writes complete before a request finishes, and the corresponding analytics reports are flushed reliably. Uninstalling a protocol is now recorded as activity.
  - Analytics receives activity types and counts without researcher or participant descriptions, and server events are correlated with the originating browser session.
  - Interview confirmations restore focus to the control that opened them, while import and synchronization failures use concise messages without internal stack traces.

- 79db1ca: Fresco now reports the failures that stop it starting in a participant's browser.

  A browser that failed to start the application showed its error page but had no way to send the report. Deciding whether a deployment collects analytics needs a database read, so the answer was applied by a component inside the page — and when the page failed to start, that component failed with it. A deployment could be broken for every participant with nothing recorded anywhere.

  The answer now reaches the browser independently of the page rendering, so these failures are reported like any other. Deployments with analytics disabled still make no requests at all.

- e9a6522: Fresco normalizes older stored and synchronized sessions at its read boundaries, so interviews containing nullish entity attributes continue to hydrate and synchronize. Malformed synchronization JSON now returns a controlled bad-request response.
- 3f3e86b: An interview no longer loses its most recent answers when two saves are in flight at once. When a tab is hidden or closed, the browser sends the outstanding answers straight away rather than waiting behind a save already on its way to the server — so the two can overlap, and the server could finish them in either order. If the older one finished last it overwrote the newer answers with the state from a few seconds earlier. Each save now carries its position in the browser's own sequence, and the server keeps a save only when it is newer than the one the interview already holds; one that lost its race is discarded instead of rolling the participant's answers back.
- bd06a52: Interviews no longer lose their most recent answers when the app locks. If the device was put away while the last few answers were still waiting to be saved, and the security timeout had passed by the time the app was reopened, it locked before those answers reached storage and up to a few seconds of responses were discarded. Answers now reach storage within a fraction of a second of being given rather than waiting out a shared timer, and anything still outstanding is written the moment the app is put into the background — before the device can suspend it.

  **Breaking for hosts of `@codaco/interview`.** The engine no longer batches writes on the host's behalf, and no longer holds a change back while an earlier write is unresolved. `onSync` is called for every change as it happens, because only the host knows what one write costs. Hosts wrap their handler in the new `createDebouncedSyncHandler`, which rate-limits ordinary changes to one write per interval carrying the newest state, and never runs two writes at once. A host writing its own handler must not run its writes concurrently: a slow earlier write landing after a newer one would persist stale answers.

  `SyncHandler` gains a third argument. `immediate` marks the writes that must not be deferred — the participant exiting or finishing — and a batching host must stop batching when it sees it. `unloading` additionally marks the ones the document may not survive: it is being hidden or unloaded and may never run script again, so the host should use a transport that outlives it and must not queue the write behind a request that will die with it. Handlers that ignore the argument keep type-checking, so hosts that write eagerly need no change.

  The Shell also now flushes on `visibilitychange` and `pagehide`. A hidden document is not promised any more script, so anything still outstanding goes out while there is still a page to write from — which is what makes an installed PWA safe to put to sleep seconds after an answer.

- c37a801: Applications now derive their protocol schema compatibility from the interview runtime they embed, instead of hard-coding a version number, and each application can upgrade stored protocols when a future schema version ships.

  - `@codaco/interview` exports its supported protocol schema version as `COMPATIBLE_PROTOCOL_SCHEMA_VERSION` (from `@codaco/interview/protocol-schema-version`). Fresco and Interviewer read it for import limits, stored-data migration, and interview payloads; Architect derives its own compatibility from `@codaco/protocol-validation` directly.
  - Interviewer checks stored protocols at launch. A protocol saved under an older schema version is migrated, re-identified under its new content hash, and its interview sessions and media follow it in a single transaction, with a notification when this happens. A protocol that cannot be migrated is left untouched, with a message directing you to repair it in Architect.
  - Architect upgrades a library protocol automatically when you open it, with a notification, leaving the protocol untouched if the upgrade cannot complete. Protocols made with a newer version of Architect are refused with an explanation instead of opening incorrectly.
  - Fresco's deployment migration targets the runtime's supported version rather than a fixed number, and an interview can no longer start from a protocol stored under a version the runtime does not support — it reports the mismatch instead.

  Nothing changes for existing data today — every stored protocol is already at the current schema version. This machinery exists so a future schema version change cannot orphan interview sessions or mislabel stored protocols.

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e84f2d1: Participants can now adjust the interview's text size. The interview navigation
  carries a settings menu with a "Text size" control offering 90%–130% of the
  default size, scaling text, spacing, and touch targets together. The change
  previews live while the menu is open and lasts for the rest of the session. The
  control is fully keyboard operable and announces its state to screen readers.

  This release also picks up the latest Network Canvas interview and interface
  updates:

  - Tablets render the interview at its full text size again. Every viewport
    narrower than 1280px had been rendering below the intended base size, which
    also shrank spacing and touch targets. Editable fields never render below 16px
    now either, so focusing one no longer makes iOS Safari zoom the page.
  - Nodes stay fully visible when moved to the edge of the Sociogram, Narrative,
    and Network Composer canvases, instead of being partially cut off on wide
    displays.
  - A scrolled roster stays where it was after an item is dragged out of it,
    rather than jumping back to the top.
  - Exporting large interviews no longer stalls the progress display, and
    cancelling an export releases the partially built archive immediately.
  - Timestamps in the dashboard's tables render immediately instead of appearing a
    moment after the row, so selecting a row no longer makes them flicker.
  - Unchecked options in dropdown menus no longer show a check indicator.

### Patch Changes

- 215e2ef: Exported interview data now identifies each case by the participant's
  identifier rather than their label. A label is optional and need not be unique,
  so any study using labels was exporting cases under a name that could repeat
  between participants and did not match the identifier used by recruitment links
  and the participants table.

  Clearing a participant's label now removes it. The edit appeared to succeed
  while the old label was silently kept.

  Editing a participant's identifier now refreshes the interviews table, which
  previously kept showing the old identifier until something else changed.
